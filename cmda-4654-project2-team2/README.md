# CMDA 4654 Project 2
### Team 2 - Lukas Coffey, Chandler Crescentini, Ben Zevin, Juhong Hyun
This project includes the work the four of us did in our Fall 2019 machine learning class (CMDA 4654).

Our assignment was to design and create a lecture that covered the theory and implementation of boosted trees. We focused specifically on gradient boosting in our presentation. 

This project took many hours and a lot of hard work, we are proud of it!

## Setup
To run the project, make sure you have RStudio installed. Once you have the repo, change the working directory in the `FinalPresentation.Rmd` file to your own file location. You can `knit` the project and it should compile, but be aware that it can take up to 15 minues to compile (it's making thousands of trees).

## Final Presentation
To view the final presentation without compiling, just view or download the file `FinalPresentation.pdf`.
